  Last night at my city's JS meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/StrasbourgJS/">StrasbourgJS</a>, I talked about the new features and syntax changes of the next version of Javascript, ES6. The slides can be found <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ksol/javascript-es6-overview">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Luke Hoban's <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features">overview of ES6</a> was my main source for preparing this talk, so kudos to him for his work. If you're interested in what direction the language is taking, you should definitely read it.
</p>

<p>
  If you're eager to use these features today, <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and its fork <a href="https://iojs.org">io.js</a> both have some level of baked-in support for them. For browser development, <a href="https://6to5.org">6to5</a> is a project compiling ES6 in ES5, allowing you to use new features without worrying about browser implementation.
</p>

<p>
  And if you're using <a href="http://www.ember-cli.com">Ember CLI</a>, though it came with ES6 modules support for quite some time, the latest version (0.1.7) bundles 6to5, giving ember developers full support for ES6 features.
