  Up until now, this blog has been a collection of articles about technical topics mostly related to ember.js, javascript, and ruby. We are on a technical blog, after all. Or should I say, we were.
</p>

<p>
  As time went by, I noticed I had a writing pattern: I would be inspired for a few articles, stick with my schedule for a few weeks, and when the list or topics I want to explore or feel comfortable enough about to write about is dry, I'll stop for a few weeks again until it comes back.
</p>

<p>
  I've considered "forcing" myself to write one post every week, hoping that the constraint of the deadline would stimulate me. But this is just not how I enjoy writing. I don't want to find stuff to write about because I <em>have</em> to; I want it to be an actual desire, something I need to do.
</p>

<p>
  These last few months, I found myself wanting to write about other subjects (non tech-related), but I felt that this was not an appropriate place, and did not want to setup another blog or open an account on some publishing platform.
</p>

<p>
  As of now, this changes: this blog is no longer a technical one. The previous posts will stay up and their URL will not change; for the time being, there will not be a split between my technical writing and my other writings. That could change in the future though, at which point I'll let you know.
</p>

<p>
  I'm hoping what I will write about will be of some interest to some of you. I know of a few things I want to write about, and maybe I'll try my hand to fiction sometime. I'm leaving the comments section opened for the time being, but should it ever becomes a space with negative voices being expressed, they will be gone.
