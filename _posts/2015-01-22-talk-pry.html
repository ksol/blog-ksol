  Almost a year ago, I gave a talk at a <a href="http://rubyparis.org">Ruby Paris</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/parisrb/">meetup</a> about <a href="http://pryrepl.org">Pry</a>. Pry describes itself as a powerful alternative to the standard IRB shell for Ruby, featuring syntax highlighting, a flexible plugin architecture, runtime invocation and source and documentation browsing.
</p>

<p>
  Pry has been part of my toolbelt for years now, and I cannot conceive developing anything in ruby without it. It comes with lots of stuff making development easier: shell integration, objects/classes inspection, quick access to docs and source code, among others.
</p>

<p>
  I highly recommand checking it out if you are developing anything in ruby, wether a web app or a CLI tool. Pry's <a href="https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki">wiki</a> is a very good resource to know what it can do and how.

  You can find my slides <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ksol/lightning-talk-pry">here</a> and the video of the talk is embedded below. It was my first time speaking in front of a crowd, so hopefuly you'll excuse my accent!
