  Brian Cardarella wrote some time ago that <a href="http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/04/28/dont-override-init.html">you should not override the method init, but rather listen to the event of the same name</a>. His article makes lots of sense, but sadly the <code>init</code> event is still little known. So I thought I could <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/10198">update the API docs</a> and make it a little less hidden.
</p>

<p>
  This triggered an interesting discussion on the differences between overriding the method or listening to the event.
</p>

<p>
  Regarding the <code>init</code> method :
</p>

<ul>
  <li>its content <strong>will not</strong> trigger change events;</li>
  <li>you <strong>can</strong> control the order of  execution inside the method;</li>
  <li>you <strong>can</strong> refine what <code>_super</code> does.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  As for the event <code>init</code>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>handlers <strong>will</strong> trigger change events;</li>
  <li>you <strong>cannot</strong> be assured of the call order if there is more than one event handler on <code>init</code>;</li>
  <li>you <strong>cannot</strong> (or not easily) refine previously attached handlers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I still think the event is often more useful than overriding, but the differences listed above should be known. When writing a library, for instance, you probably should override the method so the users can feel free to refine what <code>init</code> does if they need to.
</p>

<p>
  The Ember team will discuss this issue and we can expect some clarification on the role of the event in the future. When they do, I'll let you know where we stand on this matter.

  If you have more to say on the topic, please comment away or get in touch with me. Thanks for your time!
