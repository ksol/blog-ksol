<p>
  Ember.js has recently deprecated its <code>ObjectController</code>, since the automatic "proxying" of properties to the model is now an anti-pattern (and a source of confusion for beginners).
</p>

<p>
  While <code>ArrayController</code> is not yet deprecated, you should stay away from it for the same reason. Features specific to it such as <code>itemControllers</code> can be achieved by using components instead.
</p>

<p>
  You could also sort <code>arrangedContent</code> quickly with <code>sortProperties</code> or <code>sortFunction</code>. This can be replaced with a computed property, which has the advantage of being usable from almost everywhere, and not just <code>ArrayController</code> subclasses.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Ember.computed.sort</code> (API reference <a href="http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.computed.html#method_sort">here</a>) allows you to either supply a list of sorting properties or a function. The usage is pretty straightforward:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ksol/cf199f1f76ad8221a065.js"></script>

<p>
  And that's how you sort properly in Ember.js.
