Once again, I am rebooting this blog. I've removed all the previous content, since it no longer had a place here. A clean slate, you could say.

I have been travelling more and more since last year and I found myself with a few stories to tell; this is the place where that will happen from now on.

You can already read about my first big adventure, walking the "Camino de Santiago" across France and Spain between Septembre and November of 2016 [here](http://camino2016.ksol.fr). The writing is a bit messy though, with typos here and there â€” I was a bit rushing to get it done. At some point, I'll take some time to rewrite it properly, but the "first draft" will probably stay up quite a while.

In the coming days, I'll write about my latest hike. As always, feel free to contact me either by mail or twitter!
