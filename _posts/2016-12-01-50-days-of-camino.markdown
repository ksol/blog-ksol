From September to November, I've been walking the "Camino de Santiago" across France and Spain.

I've started writing about it and you can read my account [here](http://camino2016.ksol.fr). The writing is still in progress and I'm currently at one third, but it should be completed by the end of the year.

I hope you'll enjoy reading and looking through the pictures :)
